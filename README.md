# Manual Software Testing Project - Fabrilife  

This project involves manual testing of **Fabrilife**, an e-commerce platform widely used by people in Bangladesh for purchasing clothing and fashion items. Over the course of the project, I identified and reported **over 1000 issues** spanning various aspects of software testing, including **UI, functional, non-functional, usability, security, performance, and database testing**.  

## Getting Started  

These instructions will help you understand the project and the testing process carried out.  

### Prerequisites  

Ensure you have the following tools and software installed for testing:  

- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge  
- **Spreadsheet Software**: Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets (for creating test cases and reports)  
- **Mind Mapping Tool**: XMind (for visualizing workflows and test diagrams)  
- **Screenshot Tool**: Lightshot (for capturing visual issues)  

### Project Setup  

1. **Access Fabrilife**: Visit the live Fabrilife platform via [https://www.fabrilife.com](https://www.fabrilife.com).  
2. **Credentials**: Ensure you have test user credentials provided by the stakeholders.

## Running the Tests  

### Step-by-Step Testing Process  

1. **Plan and Scope**  
   - Identify the features and components to be tested.  
   - Create detailed test cases and scenarios using equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and error guessing techniques.  

2. **Execute Tests**  
   - Conduct smoke testing for initial stability.  
   - Perform functional, regression, and usability testing for each module.  

3. **Log Defects**  
   - Document all issues found during testing with the following details:  
     - Issue description  
     - Steps to reproduce  
     - Severity level  
     - Expected vs actual results  
     - Attach screenshots or logs if needed  

### Test Artifacts  

- **Test Cases**: Managed in Excel/Sheets with clear steps and expected outcomes.  
- **Bug Reports**: Logged in Excel or shared via email with the development team.
